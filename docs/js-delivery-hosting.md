You own the full source to your Mojito container, so you have unlimited options to host it, including: 

 - Bundling Mojito JS with your existing libraries & setting a strong cache policy for the library
 - Keeping Mojito JS in a separate library and publishing it to your own web host
 - Or if you're like us, host Mojito JS on AWS/Cloudfront with Bitbucket Pipelines for CI

In any case, you'll benefit from faster page load times & better security by self-hosting Mojito JS.
