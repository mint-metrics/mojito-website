We'll use this account to publish Mojito JS containers from your IDE and/or CI pipeline. It's a good practice to lock down the permissions on these users to the specific files/folders they need.

Before you continue - [Haven't got a Cloudfront distribution & S3 container setup? Check out the guide here.](js-delivery-hosting-s3-cf.md)

## Create an account in Amazon IAM

1.  Log in to [Amazon IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and go to the users section:

![Step 1](/img/js-delivery/aws/iam_1.png "Open 'Users' and select 'Create user'")

2.  Now hit the big blue `Create User` button to open the dialog to add a new user. Assign them a descriptive username and give them `Programmatic access`:

![Step 2](/img/js-delivery/aws/iam_2.png "Name your user and assign them programmatic access.")

3.  Continue to the user's permissions and assign them to a group with the appropriately locked down `Policy`: 

![Step 3](/img/js-delivery/aws/iam_3.png "Add them to an appropriately locked down policy or group")

If you don't have one yet, we suggest [creating a policy through IAM's visual editor](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies$new?step=edit).

We ensure users are locked down to the specific resources they require:

```json

...
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::mojito-example/js/container-name.js",
        "arn:aws:s3:::mojito-example/jsdev/container-name*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::mojito-example"
    ]
...

```

This ensures access to your other S3 buckets and containers' environments are locked down tightly. Meanwhile, wildcards come in handy for publishing `container-name.pretty.js` or setting up other blanket policies.

[![Step 3B](/img/js-delivery/aws/iam_3b.png "Use the visual editor to craft a policy with appropriate access.")](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies$new?step=edit)

4.  (Optional) Add tags to the user if you need them, or skip to the next step

![Step 4](/img/js-delivery/aws/iam_4.png "Adding user tags")

5.  Review the user's settings and if all is OK, hit `Create user`.

![Step 5](/img/js-delivery/aws/iam_5.png "Review settings")

6.  Take note of the user's Access Key ID and Secret - these are the credentials Mojito's build script will use to publish to AWS from your IDE or Bitbucket Pipeline.

## Install and set up the AWS CLI tool (to allow publishing via the CLI)

Follow [Amazon's AWS CLI installation & setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) using the credentials you created in Step #1. We won't cover this here.

Now you can publish straight from your IDE:

```bash

npm run deploy

```

And if your user has access to production, they can push to your configured production environment through the `--production` flag:

```bash

npm run build && npm run publish --production

```

## Repeat this step for other users

We suggest adding the following users:

-   Bitbucket production environments
-   Bitbucket development environments
-   Individual developers who need to publish to specific environments from their IDEs

For easy maintenance, use roles and groups that have your Mojito policies attached.

## Next steps

Continue to [set up Bitbucket Pipelines for Continuous Integration from a Web UI](js-delivery-hosting-bitbucket.md).

Or if you're publishing via the CLI, you may want to [install Mojito JS into your site](js-delivery-hosting-snippet.md).
