Hash-based user assignment brings experimenters many benefits in running split tests. It's used extensively [in the industry](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/2007GuideControlledExperiments.pdf) (section 4.1.2, page 6), at companies like [LinkedIn, Google, Microsoft and many others](https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/engineering/site-assets/pdfs/ABTestingSocialNetwork_share.pdf). Compared to the ephemeral random numbers generated from PRNGs, hash-based decisioning gives you far greater control:

-   Consistent assignment across devices & platforms
-   Retroactively "track" users assigned/excluded but not tracked
-   Exclude users who may have been exposed during your canary release (aka. [partitioned ramps](example-js-delivery-partitioned-ramps))
-   The ability to "back-test" your assignment before launching (e.g. see which treatment groups the last 30 days' users would have seen)

![Hash-based assignment lets you reliably assign a user to the same treatment across platforms](/img/examples/hash-based-assignment-outcome.png)

As long as you have a consistent user ID across platforms, users will be bucketed the same way everywhere.

You'll be amazed how simple this is.

## How it works

In Mojito, we turn a hash function's digest into a PRNG by:

1.  Calculating the hash digest of the `user ID` + `test salt`
2.  Converting the resulting hex digest into an integer & dividing by the largest number in the space for a decision between `0` and `1`
3.  Applying the resulting decisions to the user being bucketed `decision < 0.5 ? control() : treatment()`

The meta discussion around `cryptographic hash functions === PRNGs` is beyond the scope of this article, but there's a lot of discussion in the literature about why this works. And there's also some approachable Stack Overflow posts that make the case for Hash-based PRNGs. 

Also, it's worth noting some tools calculate the modulo of the hex digests' integer. However due to our variable recipe sample rates, we need to supply a value between 0 and 1.

### Hash functions

If you're unfamiliar with hash functions, like MD5/SHA256 etc, their purpose is to distill your input data down to a fixed-length hexadecimal string. It works like this:

And luckily for us, the hexadecimal output can be parsed into numbers we can use for bucketing/assignment.

## Using hashes as your PRNG in Mojito

Using a user/cookie ID and Mojito's `decisionAdapter`, we can control how users are bucketed. We'll take the `user`/`cookie ID` and send it through a hashing function to deterministically generate a really solid random numbers between 0 and 1:

### 1. Hash the user's ID & the experiment's salt

Each time you generate a hash from a seed, you'll get the same result. For our purposes we use MD5 as the hashing function because [its properties make it well-suited to a split testing](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/2007GuideControlledExperiments.pdf). 

```js

var userId = '1234567';
var testSalt = 'ex3';
var seed = userId + testSalt;
// result: '1234567ex3'

var md5Hash = Mojito.utils.md5('1234567ex3'); 
// result: '404c9f9d26876611359c2a6472012d53'

```

### 2. Generate the decisions for an experiment

We can derive psuedorandom numbers from the hexadecimal values of the hash digest `404c9f9d26876611359c2a6472012d53`, like so:

```js

parseInt('404c9f9d', 16);
// result: 1078763421 (0x404c9f9d)

parseInt('404c9f9d', 16) / 0xffffffff;
// result: 0.25116918172016023

```

For each test, we need to make 2-3 decisions. And each decision uses a quarter of the hash digest:

1.  Test sample rate: `0x404c9f9d / 0xffffffff` -> `0.25116918172016023`
2.  Recipe assignment: `0x26876611 / 0xffffffff` -> `0.15050352019036736`

Each 'decision' is capable of producing over 4 billion values - more than enough granularity for our purposes (it's probably overkill). More 'secure' hash functions exist, but we only need speed & reliability. We picked it because MSFT/LinkedIn et al use it, MD5 digests are pervasive across DBs/languages, and from our testing at Mint Metrics, it produces nice flat & even distributions:

### 3. Use the 'decisions' in your assignment

Consider the following experiment:

```yml

state: live
sampleRate: 0.5
id: ex3
name: Homepage button
recipes:
  '0':
    name: Control
    sampleRate: 0.1
  '1':
    name: Treatment
    sampleRate: 0.9
trigger: trigger.js

```

And taking the example decisions from the user above, we know the decisions they will get:

-   Test sample rate: `0.251... < 0.5` -> Included in test
-   Recipe assignment: `0.15... > 0.1` -> Assigned to `Treatment`

No matter when/where this user is bucketed (e.g. app/web/server) they will **always** get the same decisions because of their user ID.

## Apply it in Mojito

Hopefully, this gets you excited about using hash functions in your split tests.

Mojito users can swap out our default `decisionAdapater` with their own hashing functions and logic. Don't like `MD5`? Go with `SHA-256`! Prefer adding more salt? It's up to you.

See the [API reference for the decision adapter](js-delivery-api-decision-adapter) for more details and to implement your own.
